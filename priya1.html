                <p class="center">An exotic dish that is another healthy option (please ignore that pouring ghee) for
                    vegetarians out there. The dish is extremely helpful in severe cold and for people with weak
                    appetite. Prepared from bajra, ghee and warm ginger juice, jaggery, this dish is equally rich in
                    iron and magnesium.</p>
                <p class="center">Healthy food means fresh, unprocessed, local foods that you have to wash to eat. It means foods that have less than 10 ingredients and no ingredients you can’t pronounce. It means a connection to the source of your food, having access to beneficial, culturally-specific foods and having a safe place to enjoy them with your family and loved ones. Almost all packaged food products in the grocery store are required to follow FDA (Food and Drug Administration) nutrition labeling regulations. These regulations include a specific definition for the term “healthy.” Any food labeled as “healthy” must meet criteria for fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, and contain beneficial nutrients.Healthy food works in an intricate, complex way with not only our bodies, but also with our culture, ceremony, traditions, family, and societal structures. It is a daily partner in everyday life, taking care of us as we take care of it.</p>
